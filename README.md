# VaugeTime
Vague representation of time.
Yes, I am aware that I misspelled "vague" in the project name. This is something I smashed together over the course of like fourty minutes. I don't care.

WHAT IT IS:
A simple windows forms app that displays the time using text. To be more accurate, it displays what is nearly the correct time most of the time.
It rounds the time to the nearest fifteen minute interval. English only, it has no concept of languages or regions or daylight time or any of that stuff.

It also has a notification area icon. The icon hovertext displays the (approximate) time. Double-clicking on the icon spawns a notification bubble with this approximation as well.


FUTURE PLANS:
None. This app was cobbled together in next to no time with no plans for the future. I have a general idea that a deskband could be created to display the word time right in the taskbar, but no idea or motivation to actually make it so.
You're welcome to fork it and do it yourself. Or don't, I don't care.
